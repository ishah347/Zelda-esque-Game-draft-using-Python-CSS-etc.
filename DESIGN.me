Credit goes to phillipjohnson on github for the basic design of my game. The way I myself went around doing this was that I wanted to create a map for my
world to take place on, so I used philipjohnson's method of creating a textfile called map.text and listing my rooms indents and rows from each other. The rooms would count as tiles
due to the fact that while my world module was reading the text, it separated it into every world or blank space and returned them as tiles, which I feel
like was the most effective way to make a map witout using pygame. I specified the qualities of the room and how they would affect the player, who I also
established as having his own characteristics, in order to make the experience as consuming as possible. I did this all in separate modules to preserve space.

I had buttons on my html page correspond to key words that signified actions the player wuld perform. I did this to make it seem like a classic video game where you would press buttons
in order to perform actions.
