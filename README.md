To run my project, you have to run the command "flask run" under the terminal ~/workspace/finalproject/finalgame/. You then click the link that arises to
take you to the website that hosts my game. The game starts you off at a room in the middle of the map, and your job is to traverse blindly across the map
to find the exit. All you are given is what actions you are able to take at the tile you're currently at. The buttons on screen allow you to move up, down, right, or left,
to look at your inventory, and, when in a battle, to attack using the strongest weapon in your inventory or flee to an adjacent tile.

You lose when your health falls to zero. As it currently stands, if one loses or wins the game and wishes to restart it, he/she has to rerun flask run.
